I was a TA for [UNC BCB715 Modeling Signaling and Regulatory Networks](https://biophysics.unc.edu/training-3/methods-in-biophysics/bcb-715-modeling-signaling-pathways/) in Fall semester of 2018. I gave 2 lectures, helped students debug solutions, answered questions, and evaluated students' performance in the class.
