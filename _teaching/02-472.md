I was a TA for [UNC BCB715 Modeling Signaling and Regulatory Networks](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/courses-offered/02-450-automation-of-scientific-research/) in Spring semester of 2020. I prepared homeworks for the class, helped students debug solutions, answered questions, and evaluated students' performance in the class.
