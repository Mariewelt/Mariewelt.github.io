* I will be tranferring to Carnegie Mellon University starting Spring 2020 to work with Dr. Olexandr Isayev
* I am a third-year Ph.D student in the [Molecular Modeling Laboratory](http://mml.web.unc.edu) at the [University of North Carolina and Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu). 
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics from [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) and my Master's degree in Computer Science from [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/). 
*  My research focuses on applications and development of deep learning methods for computational chemistry and drug design.
